Silly little program that I created to remind me to get stuff out of the oven. Yep, you read that right. I'm often at the computer when I have stuff cooking and it's just... easier than setting an alarm on my phone (mostly because I hate typing on phones, bah). 

Make the file executable: 

```bash
~/tools$ chmod +x alert.py
~/tools$ ./alert.py
```
